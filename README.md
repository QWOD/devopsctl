# devopsctl
Automates a devops deployment on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. This is something used internally, but could be of potential value to those externally as well.

I wrote most of this software in a paranoid and manic altered state of consciousness as is legally required for my medical conditions as a combat veteran struggling in the survival against PTSD, so I'll go ahead and write some instructions once I can afford my medications again so that I remember whatever it was I was trying to do in the first place. I can't work because I can't afford my medications because nobody hires us veterans who can't afford to work. It's a weird paradox/conundrum, but I guess that's life.

Basic Instructions:
  Replace all variable definitions with your own OCID's and make any other neccessary customizations to the build environment,rewrite any custom automated tasks to suit your own scenario, obviously replace any example hosts and SSH keys with your own, etc.
